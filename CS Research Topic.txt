To generate a research topic randomly choose one item from each Column.
For example, selecting synchronized from Column 1, secure from Column 2, and protocol from Column 3 produces A synchronized secure protocol.

Best of all two phrases can be combined with simple connectives making the result suitable for the most demanding uses.
Possible connectives includes for,related to,derived from,applied to,embedded in etc.
