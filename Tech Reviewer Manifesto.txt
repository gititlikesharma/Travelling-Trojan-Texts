Hi <Interviewer Name>
I understand that I am applying for Dotnet Developer role and I am happy to be interviewed based on my ability to solve business problems with .NET Framework. If your selection process prioritises other criteria, however, such as proficiency with - 
    - JS Frameworks
    - Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery
    - Containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes)  
    - Deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP)
    - Testing
... then I will not be applying for the role as I consider these to be skills which a developer should be given the chance to acquire on the job.
I am happy to participate in a single-stage code interview according to the following criteria:
    - It shall not exceed 2 hours.
    - The subject matter of the code test be representative of your business domain.
    - No abstract algorithm quizzes.
If "cultural fit" is more important to you than my ability to solve business problems with code then let's not waste each other's time as I have found this to be a convenient smokescreen for ageism and other forms of discrimination. Otherwise, if your interview process can be conducted within these guidelines I think you will find that I have a lot of experience which could add value to your business.
Regards
Hiren Sharma
