Google Blacklist Words (the capital letter indicates where the blacklist kicks in)

amaTeur 
anal (blacklists after a space)
anilinGus
anuS (there really seems to be more blacklisting in this part of the anatomy than anywhere else)
are (this is a VERY interesting one. if you stick "are" after the following words, the blacklist kicks in: jews, christians, catholics born-again christians, evangelical christians, atheists, muslims, blacks, whites, italians, mexicans, chinese, japanese, germans, arabs, french, buddhists. the blacklist does NOT kick in when these words are entered before "are": terrorists, scientologists, agnostics, seventh day adventists, jehovah's witnesses, mormons, protestants, evangelists, pentecostalists, columbians, panamanians, iranians, iraqis, koreans, persians, turks.) 
are idiotS (most any word before this phrase will generate a blacklist - this is really protecting us from ANY sort of negativity)

electrotorTure 
eroTic 
eroTism 
escoRt (used to be such a nice safe word)

ragheAd 
raging boNer 
rapE ("rape hotline" is hereby considered offensive)

rimmIng 
rosy palM (starting a third word un-blacklists, unless you want the next entry)

s&M ("s and m" is one clever away around the blacklist)
sadie lunE 
sadisM

semen (blacklists after space) 
servitUde (wait a minute - REALLY?)

style dogGy 
submissiVe 
sucK (while "blow" as usual gets a free pass)
sucKs (pretty much anything can't suck if you want to see instant results from Google)
suicide gIrls (except it's too late because typing in the g is enough to give you some irrelevant suggestions) 
sultry wOmen (but apparently there's nothing wrong with "sultry men")

swingEr
taiNted love (suggestions are given but no results for the number one hit)
taste my (a,c,d,f,m,o,p,w all result in a blacklist - you figure out the rest)

venus mounD 
vibratoR 
violet bLue (yet another blacklisted sexologist)
violet wAnd (but "violet ray" IS allowed which is basically the older name for the same device - used to be sold for medical purposes, but used for BDSM play in modern days) 
viviD (probably because of Vivid Video - way to ruin the word for everyone else, guys)
vorarEphilia 
voyEur 
vulva (after a space, suggestions are given but no results) 
wanK

wartenberg Wheel

wet dreaM (God forbid)
wetbaCk 
white PowEr (but not "Black Power" - it's all in the marketing, after all)
women rappIng (there does seem to be some musical bias at Google)
wrapping meN (this one is a genuine mystery to us - and yes, "wrapping women" shows up fine) 
wrinkled starfiSh 
xX (probably the quickest way to trigger a blacklist)
yaoI
yellow showerS (singular is fine as you may be looking for a yellow shower curtain) 
yiffY 
zoopHilia 
heroiN
marijuanA
