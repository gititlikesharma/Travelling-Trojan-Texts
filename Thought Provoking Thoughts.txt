Cast the bantling on the rocks; suckle him with the she-wolfâ€™s teat,
Wintered with the hawk and fox; power and speed be hands and feet.

Trust no future, however pleasant; let the past bury its dead,
Act, act in the living present, heart within, and God overhead.

Is this the land your Fathers loved, the freedom which they toiled to win ?
Is this the earth whereon they moved, are these the graves they slumber in ? 

To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false
while to say of what is that it is and of what is not that it is not is true. 

Thy walls of chalcedony; thy bulwarks diamonds square,
Thy gates of right pearl; exceeding rich and rare!

Hope is the thing with feathers, that perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words, and never stops at all !
