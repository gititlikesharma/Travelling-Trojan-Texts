Puzzles :- 

1.In a family of eight persons - P, Q, R, S, T, U, V and W - there are four males and four females.
There are three married couples and two persons are unmarried.
Each of them reads a different magazine, viz India Today (R), India Today (H), Outlook (E), Outlook (H), Frontline, The Week, Businessworld and Sportsstar.
No couple reads both the versions of the same magazine.
In the family of two generations, each male member except W has two brothers and one sister.
V is the mother-in-law of R and who reads India Today (H).
Q, who reads Outlook (E), is the daughter-in-law of W.
T, who reads Frontline, is the unmarried brother of U, who does not read Businessworld.
No female reads Outlook (H) or The Week.
S is the brother-in-law of R but he does not read Businessworld, Sportsstar or The Week.
P does not read The Week.
W has no son-in-law.
U is Q's sister-in-law.

Which letter/person reads which magazine ?

Answer - 
First, let us determine the relations.
We know that 3 of the 4 male members (the remaining 4th being W) are brothers of each other (otherwise they could not have 2 brothers each). One of them is T (we know that T is male because he is U's brother), and now we know that U is the only sister of the three. Who are T's other 2 brothers?
Obviously neither of U, V and Q, since all of them are female. S is one of them since both remaining male members of the family (apart from T and W) should be T's brothers. But R cannot be T's brother since S is brother-in-law (not the blood brother) of R. So, the 3rd (remaining) brother is P.
So, P, S and T are brothers, and U is their only sister. Since S is the brother-in-law of R, then R (being female) must be married to one of the S's brothers. It must be P since T is unmarried.
Since V is the mother-in-law of R, she must be the mother of P,S,T and U. U is Q's sister-in-law, that is, Q is married to U's brother, namely S (since T is unmarried, and P is married to R). Q is W's daughter-in-law, so W must be V's husband.
Now, let us proceed to the newspapers. First, we know that R reads India Today (H) (since V is R's and Q's mother-in-law, and Q reads other newspaper), Q reads Outlook (E), and T reads Frontline. S does not read Businessworld, Sportsstar or The Week, so he must read either India Today (R) or Outlook (H). But S is Q's husband who also reads Outlook, so S must read India Today (R).
The Week and Outlook (H) are read by male members, that is, P and W (since S and T read something other). P does not read The Week, so he reads Outlook (H), and W reads The Week. U does not read Businessworld, so she must read Sportsstar, the only remaining newspaper. And Businessworld should remain to V.
Final answer (apart from the family tree):
P reads Outlook (H),
Q reads Outlook (E),
R reads India Today (H),
S reads India Today (R),
T reads Frontline,
U reads Sportsstar,
V reads Businessworld,
W reads The Week.
Note:
The clause "V is the mother-in-law of R and who reads India Today (H)" is interpreted as if R and one who reads India Today (H) could be the same person (and in fact, it is). If we assume that these must be different persons, we get a contradiction.

2.There are 52 cards on a table and numbered in order from 1 to 52 with number 1 on top. 
The following operation can be repeatedly done: split the pile into two piles without shuffling and take cards from the top of the two piles in any order and build one new pile from top to bottom.
What is the minimum number of operations, which is needed to revert the original pile, i.e. from 1,2,3,...,50,51,52 to 52,51,50,...,3,2,1?

Answer - The optimal strategy takes six operations using Radix Sort technique !

3.Professor Matlogic posed this question to his smartest math student :-

"Famous mathematician Ensquare was born on this day, this month and this year AD at this time (hour and minutes) pm. True to his name, all those five numbers (the day, month, year, hour and also minutes-seperate from hour number-) were square numbers. So can you tell me when Ensquare was born exactly?"
"No, I cannot" said the student.
"OK then. What if I tell you that those 5 numbers are made up of digits 1 to 9,with each digit used exactly once. No repeats. Now, can you?"
"Hmm. Let me think."
"No I cannot still" the student after a long thought.
"OK then. He was born on a Wednesday" Professor declared.
"Now I know!" said the student cheerfully.
Do you know ? What is the logic?

Answer - Ensquare was born on 25/04/81 at 09:36 and its a Wednesday too !
Logic - 
First let us get which numbers qualify for the month, hours, days, and minutes. That is a count of 7 (1,4,9,16,25,36,49) numbers that need to fill 4 spots.
I then went the long way around and listed all squares from 1 to 2021. First I removed any number that had a repeated digit or a number that contained a 0, this left us with 27 numbers to choose from for the year.
Looking at the 7 numbers for the min/hr/day/mnth spots, we can see that if the year contains a 6 and a 9, that would eliminate 4 of our 7 numbers (9, 16, 36, 49) and we wouldn't have enough left to populate our min/hr/day/mnth spots. Similarly, a year containing a 4 and a 6 would eliminate 4 numbers (4, 16, 36, 49). Similarly (again), if the year contains a 4 and a 9 that would eliminate 3 numbers (4, 9, 49) and then 16 would clash with 1 and 36. This leaves us with 17 years to choose from.
From here we can start checking numbers. If there are less than 4 valid numbers, it is a bust and we can throw it out. I don't know how to make a table, so this is the best I can do.
Year | valid numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36)
841 | 9, 25, 36 (bust)
784 | 1, 9, 16, 25, 36
729 | 1, 4, 16, 36 (bust, 36 and 16 clash)
625 | 1, 4, 25, 49 (bust, 4 and 49)
576 | 1, 4, 9, 49 (bust, 4 and 49)
529 | 1, 4, 16, 36 (bust, 1 and 16)
361 | 4, 9, 25, 49 (bust 4, and 49)
324 | 1, 4, 9, 16, 49 (bust, 4 and 49/1 and 16)
289 | 1, 4, 16, 36 (bust, 1 and 16)
256 | 1, 4, 9, 49 (bust, 4 and 49)
81 | 4, 9, 25, 36
36 | 4, 9, 25, 49 (bust, 4 and 49)
25 | 1, 4, 9, 16, 36, 49
16 | 4, 9, 25, 49 (bust, 4 and 49)
9 | 1, 4, 16, 25, 36
4 | 1, 9, 16, 25, 36
1 | 4, 9, 25, 36, 49
This leaves us with the years 784, 81, 25, 9, 4, 1 as possible solutions
From there I calculated valid dates starting with the largest year, and then checked their day of the week at timeanddate.
For year 784, the number 36 has to be the minutes (it is too large for month, day, or hour) and 25 has to be the day (too large for month or hour).
year | month | day | hour | min
784 | 9 | 25 | 1 | 36 (Saturday)
784 | 1 | 25 | 9 | 36 (Sunday)
For year 81, the number 36 has to be the minutes and 25 has to be the day from similar logic as above.
year | month | day | hour | min
81 | 9 | 25 | 4 | 36 (Thurs)
81 | 4 | 25 | 9 | 36 (Wednesday)

5.Five positive integers should be put in a row such that each integer is the sum of the digit sum of its neighbours.
The integers at the beginning and at the end have only one neighbour, i.e the first integer is the digit sum of the second integer, the fifth integer is the digit sum of the fourth integer.
What is the smallest sum of those five integers ?

Answer - Smallest sum is 45.
Logic - 
Possible Solutions are as follows :- 
1 10 9 17 8
2 11 9 16 7
3 12 9 15 6
4 13 9 14 5
5 14 9 13 4
6 15 9 12 3
7 16 9 11 2
8 17 9 10 1
Reasoning
Let a b c d e be a solution. Then (writing [] for digit sum) c = a + e = [b] + [d]. Also, b = 2[b] + [d] and d = [b] + 2[d]. Therefore b and d must be multidigit. The smallest possible way is b = 10 + B and d = 10 + D where B = a - 1 and D = e - 1 are single digit. From this it follows that c = a + e = 9.

6.Seasons pass within a day and the sun moves in reverse. I am in love with this place. Where am I ?

Answer - Venus / South Pole
Venus Logic - 
I think you are on Venus where the Sun goes in the opposite direction across the sky as compared to Earth because the rotation of Venus is opposite that of earth and
One Venus year = 1.92 Venus days, so about 2 seasons per day, and you love it Venus, Goddess of Love.
South Pole Logic -
Seasons pass within a day
A "day" , if counted from one sunrise to the next one, lasts 12 months on both poles. This is of course the same period of time it takes for the seasons to cycle.
The sun moves in reverse.
Assuming we're used to the sun moving clockwise across the sky as it does in the northern hemisphere. The reverse happens on the other side of the globe where the sun moves anticlockwise.

7.Who am I ?

It can't be made by a Snake,
whether it is asleep or awake.
It can be made by a Beagle,
or sometimes even by an Eagle.
Found in various places,
we humans can easily make,
You dont need hands to make it,
Did this puzzle make your head shake ?

Answer - Footprint
Logic - Snakes don't have feet so cannot make them but beagles and eagles both have feet as do humans and footprints can be found in various places.

8.Using creative thinking can you show all four equations follow the same logic/method.
9 = 4
9 = 8
9 = 14
9 = 24

Hint - Think Roman Numeral for LHS.

Answer - 
IX = 2/3 of the word SIX = 2/3×6=4
IX = 2/9 of THIRTY SIX = 2/9×36=8
IX = 1/4 of FIFTY SIX = 1/4×56=14
IX = 2/5 of SIXTY = 2/5×60=24

12.You come across two people. 
One is a liar who always lies and the other is a truthteller who always tell the truth. You don't know who is who though.
Both these people are allowed to say one sentence each. What shall each of them say to prove their identity ?
Note: Both need to prove their identities individually. Just the truthteller proving his identity or just the liar proving his identity is not enough.

Answer - 
Truthteller will say - "One of us two is a truthteller" is true / 2+2=4 is true
Liar will say - "One of us two is a truthteller" is false / 2+2=5 is false

13.4 players enter a race. 
The judge is not at the finish line to judge the ending. 
When the judge shows up to award the prize, these are the statements by 4 players :-
Alpha - I won the race
Beta - I came in last
Gamma - I did not finish last
Theta - I was neither first nor last
The judge goes to Alpha to hand the prize, when a member from the audience who has been watching the race all along shouts - "Exactly one of these 4 is lying".
To whom should judge award the prize ?

Answer :-
Here's the situation if no one lied i.e Alpha at 1st , Beta at 4th, Gamma & Theta at 2nd or 3rd.
If Alpha lied , then Gamma must have won and Beta must have come last.
If it's Beta, no one comes last. This is not a valid race.
If it's Gamma, both Beta and Gamma comes last. This is not a valid race either.
If it's Theta, Alpha must have won and Beta must have come last. There's no place for Theta.
Conclusion : Alpha lied and the real winner is Gamma.

24.If O^3 = DAD and (I*M) ^ 2 = MOM, then what is MAID ?

Answer :- It can be seen that O^3=DAD can only happen with 7^3=343 and (I*M) ^ 2 = MOM can only happen with (2*6) ^ 2=676 and hence the value of MAID is 6423.

25.I have 4 brothers
My 1st brother is a bother, and points everything out.
My 2nd brother is tall, and quite foul at heart.
My 3rd brother is about as tall as my 1st, and quite decorative.
My 4th brother is short and skinny, but among the strongest of us all.
I am short and squat and weak, but am by far the most useful.

What are we ?

Answer :- Five Fingers of a Hand
Narrator - Thumb
My 1st brother is a bother, and points everything out. -> The index finger is used to point at something.
My 2nd brother is tall, and quite foul at heart. -> The middle finger is usually the longest of all fingers.
My 3rd brother is about as tall as my 1st, and quite decorative. -> The ring finger is often as long as the index and carry all sorts of rings
My 4th brother is short and skinny, but among the strongest of us all. 
-> The 4th brother is the pinky, short and skinny, but among three of the strongest fingers of the hand.

27.I run uphill faster than downhill
People don't touch me, that's chill
I tend to destroy more than create
But I can be used to make something great
I am loud and I eat, but I have no mouth
I travel around, west, east, north, or south
People hate me, yet love me as well
The smaller, the better, that's what they tell

What am I ?

Answer :- Fire
Logic - 
I run uphill faster than downhill - Fire travels faster going upwards because hot air is pushed upward and cold air is consequently pulled in from underneath.
People don't touch me, that's chill -Usually, people don't touch fire. That's chill, because if they did touch fire, it wouldn't be very chill anymore.
I tend to destroy more than create - Fire does create, but it mostly just destroys, specifically, whatever it's burning.
But I can be used to make something great - Food, I guess. Also glass. And various other things.
I am loud and I eat, but I have no mouth - No mouth. But fire is quite loud, and I suppose it "eats" fuel (and oxygen).
I travel around, west, east, north, or south - Well, fire spreads indiscriminately of direction.
People hate me, yet love me as well - Forest fires really suck. But we also couldn't live without it to warm us, help us travel, cook food, etc.
The smaller, the better, that's what they tell - Smaller fires are better, in general; large fires get out of control and then cause damage and death.

28.Steal my prefix and perform a sacrifice.
Steal my suffix and venture all over ice.
Steal my infix and a shove from fatality.
Steal my whole and forget a part of me.

What am I ?

Answer :- Skill
Logic -
Steal my prefix and perform a sacrifice - Remove the prefix S to make KILL
Steal my suffix and venture all over ice - Remove the suffix LL to make SKI
Steal my infix and a shove from fatality - Remove the infix K and you are left standing on a SILL
Steal my whole and forget a part of me - Remove all the letters - lose a SKILL and you forget how to do a particular task.

29.The eight vertices of a cube are marked with numbers from 1 to 8 such that the sum of any three numbers on any face is not less than 10.
What is the minimum sum of the four numbers on a face ?

Answer :- 16
Logic - 
Let n be the largest number on the face with the smallest sum. 
The remaining three numbers on that face must sum to at least 10 so cannot be all less than 5 (2+3+4=9) the largest must therefore be at least 6 + 10 = 16.

30.You are given a rectangle with base b and height h with h,b>0. What is the minimum side length of a square, which completely covers this rectangle ?

Answer :- min((h+b)/√2,h)
Logic - 
An optimal cover can always be chosen to have the centroids of the rectangle and the covering square aligned. Because by rotational symmetry of the rectangle the covering square rotated by 180° around the centroid of the rectangle will also cover, hence will the intersection of the original and the rotated square, and this will be a symmetric around the centroid of the rectangle.

31.Can you fill a 4x4 grid with every number from 1 to 16, such that every row, every column and every 2x2 sub-grid of numbers sum to the same value ?

Logic - 
For a 4*4 Matrix - 
A B C D
E F G H
I J K L
M N O P
 
Constraints that needs to be satisfied are as below - 
A+B = G+H = I+J = O+P
C+D = E+F = K+L = M+N
A+E = J+N = C+G = L+P
I+M = B+F = K+O = D+H
B+C = J+K = E+H = M+P
F+G = N+O = A+D = I+L
E+I = G+K = B+N = D+P
F+J = H+L = A+M = C+O
which are enough constraints to make it manageable by trial and error.

32.Can you fill a 3x3 grid with every number from 1 to 9, such that the sum of numbers in the first row is equal to the sum of numbers in every 2x2 sub-grid ?

33.Professor Devonshire was losing his marbles, Dr. Wallaby thought, staring at the equations filling the board in Dr. Devonshire’s office. What kind of addition was this ?
1+1 = 6
2+1 = 6
1+6 = 6
2+6 = 6
6+6 = 6
1+3 = 8
7+9 = X
X stands for ?

Answer :- 9
Logic - 
The addition is the number of letters in each one of the numbers to the left of the equal sign.
So,
one + one = 6 letters
two + one = 6 letters
one + six = 6 letters
two + six = 6 letters
six + six = 6 letters
one + three = 8 letters &
seven + nine = 9 letters

34.How many ways are there to split the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 into two groups, such that the product of the numbers in one group is 24 and the sum of the numbers in the other group is 12 ?

Answer :- The only possibility is - 1+5+6=12 & 2*3*4=24.

35.Who is the only pre-teen that has traveled to outer space ? This is a person, not a dog or chimpanzee or other animal.

Answer :- Jack Lousma
Reasoning - 
Jack was an astronaut born in 29 February 1936 and traveled to outer space in April 1966, which would mean he had 7 birthdays, making him a "pre-teen".

36.If I am thirty-two, I am the smallest and I am alone.
Twenty-two multiplied by four is twenty.
Eight, twelve and sixteen are my own.
If you can see me, we both have one of me.
If you don't have one of me, you can't see me.

What am I ?

Answer :- An IPv4 Address
Logic - 
If I am thirty-two, I am the smallest and I am alone - In CIDR Notation, /32 designates the smallest possible network of one IP address
Twenty-two multiplied by four is twenty - In CIDR Notation, the /20 subnet has four times as many hosts as the /22 subnet (4,096 vs 1,024)
Eight, twelve and sixteen are my own - I think these are CIDR notation subnet masks reserved for special purpose address blocks
If you can see me, we both have one of me - Both the server and viewer need to have an IP address to view this question
If you don't have one of me, you can't see me - Without an IP address a viewer could not view this question.

37.20, 21, 33, 68, 172.5, 520.5, ? What will come next in this number sequence problem ?

Answer :- The next number in the sequence is 1825.25.
Logic - 
(20 x 1.0) + 1.0 = 21
(21 x 1.5) + 1.5 = 33
(33 x 2.0) + 2.0 = 68
(68 x 2.5) + 2.5 = 172.5
(172.5 x 3.0) + 3.0 = 520.5
(520.5 x 3.5) + 3.5 = 1825.25

38.In how many ways you can arrange the numbers from 1 to 8 in an order so that three consecutive terms cannot be increasing. 
For example, 12345678 isn’t allowed but 81436572 is. How many ways are there to do it ?

Answer :- 13358 Ways
Logic - 
Use inclusion-exclusion to count all permutations with at least one increasing triplet.
For each of the possible 6 positions there are 8x7x6x5x4 = 6720 such triplets.
Pairwise intersections give increasing quadruplets,quintuplets or pairs of triplets. These contribute terms 5 x 1680, 4 x 336 and 6 x 56 x 20. The last term arises as 6 placements of two triplets, 8x7 ways to fill the two remaining cells and 20 ways to distribute 6 numbers over two tiplets.
Threeway intersections give increasing quintuplets to septuplets, and triplets paired with quadruplets or quintuplets. Terms: 4 x 336, 3 x 2 x 56, 2 x 8, 2 x 3 x 8 x 35, 2 x 56
Fourway intersections give increasing sextuplets to octuplets and pairs of quadruplets or triplets and quintuplets. Terms: 3 x 56, 2 x 3 x 8, 3 x 1, 70, 2 x 56
Fiveway intersections give increasing septuplets and octuplets. Terms: 2 x 8, 4 x 1
The full intersection gives the octuplet. Terms: 1
Taken together :-
6 x 6720 - (5 x 1680 + 4 x 336 + 6 x 56 x 20) + (4 x 336 + 3 x 2 x 56 + 2 x 8 + 2 x 3 x 8 x 35 + 2 x 56) - (3 x 56 + 2 x 3 x 8 + 3 x 1 + 70 + 2 x 56) + (2 x 8 + 4 x 1) - 1 = X
6 x 6720 - 5 x 1680 - 117 x 56 + 208 x 8 - 70 = X
40320 - 8400 - 6552 + 1664 - 70 = X
X = 26962
This we have to subtract from the full permutation count 8! = 40320.
Thus Final Answer - 40320-26962 = 13358 Ways

43.A stream of ants go from point A to point B and return to A along the same path. 
All the ants move at a constant speed and from any given point 2 ants pass per second one way. 
It takes 1 minute for an ant to go from A to B. Ho many returning ants will an ant meet in its journey from A to B ?

Answer :- 240 Ants
Logic -
Consider the situation at the moment the ant is about to start moving from A to B.
The ant will meet all the ants that are already returning from B to A. It will also meet all the ants that are ahead of him and moving to B, because they will all reach B before him and turn around and meet him while he is not yet at B.
To answer the question we therefore have to work out the total number of ants that are currently between A and B.
Consider the first ant he meets.
This ant left A two minutes ago since he went to B and back. Our ant will therefore meet all the ants that left point A in the last two minutes. At 2 ants per second, that is 240 ants.

45.There is a secret operator F that takes two whole numbers and outputs a new number. For example
F(6,9)=15
F(66,11)=110
F(86,18)=179
Can you find what F does and what is the output of F(601,81) ?

Hint: F may not be defined for all inputs.

Answer :- 127
Logic - 
Rotating the whole numbers, rather parameters, and not the individual integers, by 180 degrees and adding them together.
F(6,9) = 9+6=15
F(66,11) = 99+11=110
F(86,18) = 98+81=179
Therefore the output of F(601,81) would be -> 109+18=127

C# Code :- 
void Main()
{
  F(6,9).Dump();      //15
  F(66,11).Dump();    //110
  F(86,18).Dump();    //179
  F(601,81).Dump();   //127
 }
 int F(int x, int y)
 {
  return rotate(x)+rotate(y);
 }
 int rotate(int num)
 {
  int result =0;
  for (; num > 0; num /= 10)
  {
      int digit = num % 10;
      switch (digit)
      {
          case 0: case 1: case 2: case 5: case 8: break;
          case 3: case 4: case 7: throw new ArgumentException($"can't flip {digit}");
          case 6: digit = 9; break;
          case 9: digit = 6; break;
          default: throw new ArgumentException("I can't even");
      }
      result = result * 10 + digit;
  }
  return result;

48.I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but come alive with the wind. What am I ?

Answer :- An Echo
Logic - 
I speak without a mouth - An echo echoes without a mouth.
and hear without ears - An echo listens to you and copies you, so it listens without ears.
I have no body, but come alive with the wind - The wind of our breath allows us to hear the echo. 

49.5, 10, 6.5, 8.5, 8, 7, 9.5, 5.5, X. What is the next number X in the sequence ? 

Answer :- 11
Logic - 
5 + 10 - 6.5 = 8.5
10 + 6.5 - 8.5 = 8
6.5 + 8.5 - 8 = 7
8.5 + 8 - 7 = 9.5
8 + 7 - 9.5 = 5.5
7 + 9.5 - 5.5 = 11

56.My eight cousins are all a different prime number of years old, and their average age is a whole number. 
Recently they all came to visit me and, as they left one by one, I noticed that at all times the average age of the cousins remaining was also a whole number. Moreover, I noticed that the sum of their ages was the least it could have been for this to happen.
How old are my eight cousins ?

Answer :- 
Their ages are 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,29 which is a combined total age of 104.
This is one possible order in which they left - 13, 7, 19, 5, 3, 11, 17, 29.
Logic - 
None of their ages can be 2 since the overall sum must be even. The smallest sum of primes is then 3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23 = 98 but this is not divisible by 8. The next smallest is the solution given (which is divisible by 8) and it is not too difficult to work out an order in which they must leave to satisfy the constraints.

57.Take the first 10 primes.

Removing P, it gives EMT that sounds like EMPTY
Removing E, it gives MT that sounds like EMPTY
I guess if you removed all the characters, it'd also be EMPTY

64.We have 6 weights: 2 red, 2 black, 2 blue. 
Of each color, there is one that's 100g and one that's 101g. 
How can you identify which ones are 101g, in two measurements, with a one-armed scale ? 

Answer :- 
Name 6 weights as R1, R2, K1, K2, B1, B2.
Meansure R1 + K1 + B1
R1 + K1 + B1 = 300g: R2, K2, B2 are 101g
R1 + K1 + B1 = 301g:
Meansure R1 + K2
R1 + K2 = 200g: R2, K1, B2 are 101g
R1 + K2 = 201g: R2, K2, B1 are 101g
R1 + K2 = 202g: R1, K2, B2 are 101g
R1 + K1 + B1 = 302g:
Meansure R1 + K2
R1 + K2 = 200g: R2, K1, B1 are 101g
R1 + K2 = 201g: R1, K1, B2 are 101g
R1 + K2 = 202g: R1, K2, B1 are 101g
R1 + K1 + B1 = 303g: R1, K1, B1 are 101g

68.Imagine we have a ruler on which just numbers 0 and 2 and 5 are marked and the rest numbers are erased. How could we draw a 6 cm line by this ruler ?

Answer :- Draw from 2 to 5. Shift the ruler 3cm to the right so that the 2 mark is at the end of your line, and draw from 2 to 5 to extend your line by another 3cm.

69.2021 has started and can be written as (−9+8)*7−6*(5−(4+3)^2+1)+0=2021 For 2022 is it possible ?

Answer :- 2022 has started and can be written as (−9+8)*7−6*(5−(4+3)^2+1)+0!=2022 Also,
9876/5+4+32+10 = 2022
9876/5+43+2+1+0!=2022
9+8*7*6*(5+4−3)−2−1+0=2022
9*(8+7*6*5+4+3)−2−1+0=2022
9*8*7*(6−5)*4+3+2+1+0=2022
9*8*7*(6−5)*4+3*2+1*0=2022
(9*8*7+6−5)*4+3−2+1+0=2022
9*(8*7*6+5−4)/3*2+1*0=2022
(9*8*7*6+5+4)/3*2+1*0=2022
(9−8+7)*654−3210=2022
9+(87+654)*3−210=2022

70.Complete the sequence B - D - H - P - ?

Answer :- F
Logic -
If you convert A, B, C, ... into 1, 2, 3, ... then you get B = 2, D = 4, H = 8, P = 16. 
The simplest way to describe this pattern is that they are powers of 2, so the next value must be 32. 
Since we have only 26 letters in the alphabet, we count the letters in cycles to get the letter F. 
(Alternatively, if you know modular arithmetic, you can get F by 32 mod 26 = 6)

71.Steal my prefix and the end is here.
Steal my suffix and the end is near.
Steal my infix and there will be fear.
Steal my whole and lose your dear.
Who am I ?

Answer :- FRIEND
Logic - 
Steal my prefix and the end is here. - If we 'steal' (remove) the prefix (FRI), we literally see the word END here.
Steal my suffix and the end is near. - If we 'steal' (remove) the suffix (END), we have FRI - a shortening of Friday, which indicates that the end of the week
Steal my infix and there will be fear. - If we 'steal' (remove) the infix (R), we are left with FIEND - an evil spirit or demon, which could certainly bring much fear.
Steal my whole and lose your dear. - If we 'steal' (remove) the whole word and we will lose a dear FRIEND.

72.My prefix is a built-in python function.
My suffix is a built-in python class.
My infix is a built-in python operator.
My whole is a tasty Christmas treat !

Answer :- MINT
Logic -
My prefix is a built-in python function. - MIN() is a built-in function to find the lowest of a set or list of values.
My suffix is a built-in python class. - Variables or objects of the INT class are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.
My infix is a built-in python operator. - The IN operator enables the user to check if a particular value occurs within a particular range or sequence.
My whole is a tasty Christmas treat. - Many sweet treats at Christmas include MINT as an ingredient - generally peppermint.

73.Make the numbers from 1-10 using 5 3s.

Answer :-

3−3/3*3/3=2
3+3−3+3−3=3
3+3/3−3+3=4
((3*3)+(3+3))/3=5
(3*3)−(3−3)−3=6
(3*3)+(3/3)−3=7
3+3+((3+3)/3)=8
3+3+3+3−3=9
3/3+3+3+3=10

74.How many shapes can you form with squares ?
There is a 6 by 6 dot-grid. You will draw two squares by joining the dots.
The squares cannot have common dots/points or areas.
Rotations or reflections of a drawing are considered distinct.

Answer :- 1256 shapes.
Code -
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import colors
import shapely.geometry as sg
# plotting
col = it.cycle(colors.CSS4_COLORS)
plt.figure(tight_layout=True)

    plt.plot(*Sq.exterior.xy,"-",color=c,linewidth=3)
    plt.fill(*Sq.exterior.xy,"-",color=c,linewidth=3,alpha=0.5)
# grid
P = np.array([[sg.Point(i,j) for j in range(6)] for i in range(6)],"O")
# all squares on grid
S = [sg.Polygon([P[s+y,s+x-r],P[s+y-r,x],P[y,x+r],P[y+r,s+x]])
     for s in range(1,6) for y,x,r in it.product(*map(range,(6-s,6-s,s)))]

        if not S1&S2: # no overlap
            ps(S2,next(col))
            if j<i: # no double counts
                sol.append((S1,S2))

75.What is the maximum number of queens that can be placed on a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no one of them is capable of attacking any others in a single move ?
Answer :- 8 
Logic - According to Wolfram Alpha, there are 12 unique solutions plus an additional 80 solutions using rotations / reflections.

76.You are in a room with three switches, labeled A, B, and C. Initially, each switch is in an off state. In an adjoining room, there are three incandescent light bulbs. Your task is to correctly label which switch goes to which bulb.
The catch: you may only enter the bulb room once. You have as long as you need in the switch room, and you may flip any switch as many times as you'd like, but once you leave the switch room, you may not enter it again.
There is a way to know for certain which bulb goes to which switch. How ?

Answer :- Turn switches A and B on. Wait about a minute. Turn switch B off. Go to the bulb room. The bulb that is on corresponds to switch A. The bulb that is off, but warm, corresponds to switch B. The bulb that is off, but cold, corresponds to switch C.

Logic :- Incandescent bulbs produce a significant amount of heat. In the amount of time it takes you to walk from one room to the other, the bulb will have not had time to cool down, unless the rooms are unreasonably large.

77.What is the sum of the digits of the numbers x and y in the sequence 335,333,x,y,318,307,294,.. ?
Answer :- 16
Logic - It looks like the differences between the terms are 2, ?, ?, ?, 11, 13 which looks like the primes.
Therefore considering it , x=330 and y=325 so the sum of their digits is 3+3+0+3+2+5=16.

78.You are lost in a jungle and suddenly get caught by a tribal group who are cannibals. 
They keep you captive and however think of offering you a second chance to save your life.

Their leader says - "We will give you one chance to say something. It should be a sentence, not a question. It should not be a single word. This will make it easy for us to decide which way to kill you. If that sentence is a truth, you will be burnt to death. If it is a lie, we will shoot you."

What should the captive say to escape this tragic death ? 
Assume this tribe knows how to figure out what is true and what is false even if it is something personal to the captive.

Answer :- The best option is for the captive to say one of the following :- I will die by getting shot or I will not die by getting burnt to death.
Logic - Both of these are the same. 
If the leader thinks it's the truth, he will get burnt, but by that logic he should be lying, and therefore shot, but it's the truth, so it's a paradox ! 
Same logic for if it is a lie; if it is a lie, he gets shot, but he said the truth, so he's supposed to be burnt, but he lied about that, so again, a paradox !

79.Using any calculation through BEDMAS rule prove that 8642=9 and 8645 = 9. Numbers can only be repeated once !
Answer :- 
(8+((6-4)/2)) = (8+(2/2)) = (8+1) = 9 / (6+5-(8/4))) = (6+5-(2)) = (11-2) = 9
((6-2)/4) + 8 = (4/4) + 8 = 1+8 = 9   /  (8/(6-4))+5 = (8/2) + 5 = (4) + 5 =9

80.Every letter and every question mark stands for a digit. Different letters stand for different digits. Leading digits are always non-zero.
ALFRED ÷ E = NEUMAN
Which digit does each letter represent ? 

Answer :- 
A - 7
L - 0
F - 4
R - 8
E - 3
D - 6
N - 2
U - 1
M - 5

Logic :- We can re-write it as follows :-
NEUMAN
*    E
------
ALFRED

OK, we know E does not belongs to (0,1). 
Since the result is a 6 digit number, we know that N belongs to either (1,2,3,4).
Since E*N shows up twice, once with a D result and once with an A result, we know that the fifth column (E×E) must have a carry over.
Also, we will use the fact that the carry over for multiplying any two numbers must be less than the two numbers.
If N=4, then E=2 and A=8. But then D=8 too, which is impossible.
If N=3, then E=2 and D=6⟹A∈{7,8}. Since E2=4, we need a carry over of at least 4 from the U×E column, which is impossible.
If N=1, then E*N=D => E=D, Thus N=2 !
So E=3 and D=6 thus A is either 7 or 8. The only value that works for the second column where A*E yields E is 7 since 7*3=23.
Looking at the fifth column, E*E yields L. 
Since E2=10, we know that L is simply the carry over from the previous column, which cannot be greater than 2. Thus, L is either 0 or 1 since 2 is already taken.
Assume, L=1 So U*E has a carry over of 1, U must be 4 or 5.
The remaining values are (0,4,5,8).
And since A=7 the carry over from the second column into the third is 2.
If M=0, then M*3+2=2 so, R=2, which is already taken.
If M=4, then M*3+2=13+2 so,R=5, leaving nothing for U.
If M=8, then M*3+2=26+2 so,R=8 too.
If M=5, then M*3+2=16+2 so,R=8.
And U=4. This leave F=0, but doing the math gets 234572*3=714836 implies that F=4.
Thus L=0, U*E has a carry over of 0, so U=1.
The remaining values are {4,5,8}.
M=8 =>2318728*3=705836, so R=8
M=4 =>2314728*3=704536, so F=4
Thus, M=5 =>231572*3=704836 so R=8 and F=4.
So we have

231572
*    3
------
704836

81.Every letter and every question mark stands for a digit. Different letters stand for different digits. Leading digits are always non-zero.
ALFRED * E = NEUMAN
Which digit does each letter represent ? 

Answer :- 
A - 1
L - 6
F - 4
R - 0
E - 5
D - 7
N - 8
U - 2
M - 3

Logic :- We can see that E>1 and A must be in between (1,2,3,4) since other values would either create a leading zero or too many digits. 
Also, N is greater than both A and E.
If A=4, then E=2 and N=8. But no value for D can result in D*E yielding 8.
If A=3, then E=2. But D*E can have at most a carry over of 1. Thus, A is either 2 or 3.
Assume A=2
Then E is either 3 or 4. If E=4, then D*E must carry over 4 which is impossible.
Thus E=3 which means D*E must carry over 2 which means D is either 7 or 8 and N is either 3 or 6.
Only the second pair of these doesn't result in a conflict, so D=8 and N=6.
This means that L*E must result in no carry over. 
This is only possible if L is either 0 or 1 of the remaining valid values. 
If L=0 then we need the carry over of F*E to be E which is impossible. Thus, L=1 and the carry over of F*E is 2.
Thus, F=7. Since F*E=7*3=23, and the only remaining values for U can only be 0 or 4 or 5, we know that the carry over must be 1 and R=5.
But then we have 217538×3=645726 which gives U=7 Thus A=1
The ones column is D*E which yields a carry over less than both D and E. Lets look at the second column where adding this carry over to E*E yields A
if E=2, then it requires carry over of 6.
if E=3, then it requires carry over of 1. 
Thus, D is either 4 or 5 and N is either 3 or 6. Since 3 is already taken, we know D=5 and N=6. But this requires a carry over of 3 in the L*E spot.
if E=4, requiring carry over of 3.
if E=5, requiring carry over of 3.
if E=6, requiring carry over of 1. Thus, D=2 & N=3.
if E=7, requiring carry over of 6. Thus D=8 & N=2.
if E=8, requiring carry over of 0. Thus D & N = 0.
So, the only ones that don't lead to immediate contradiction are E which maybe either 4 or 5.
Assume E=4, so D=7,N=1,D=8 and N=5 is the only way to get our carry over of 3. We then need a carry over of 1 in the L*E spot.
So, we need to have L either 2 or 3. If L=2, then L*E=8, so we need a carry over of 5 to get E. This is impossible, so L=3.
Then, L*E=13 so in order to yield E again, we need another carry over of 1 from the F*E spot. Thus, F=2 and we need a carry over from the R*E spot. If this carry over is greater than 1, then U will conflict, so it needs to be 1 and U=0.
But now we've run out of numbers that will result in a carry over of 1 !
Thus, E=5 We need a carry over of 3, so D is either 6 or 7.
If D=6, then D*E=6*5=33. This means N=3 which is too small.
Therefore, D=7 and D*E=7*5=38 so,N=8. This means we also need a carry over of 3 from L*E, so L=6.
If, L*E=6*5=33 and we need this to yield E=5, so we need a carry over of 2 from the F*E spot. This means we need F is either 3 or 4 such that F*E is either 16 or 22. If F=3, then we need R*E to yield a carry over of 4. But 8 and 7 are already taken, and R=6 is insufficient. Thus, F=4.
The remaining values are (0,2,3). If R=2, then M=4.If R=3, then M=0 and U=4.Thus, R=0, then M=3 and U=2.

82.A man walks up a hill at 2mph, and back down the same way at 4mph. Upon returning to where he started, what is his average speed ?
Answer :- 8/3 mph
Logic - 
Let's take the distance up and down the hill as d.
Then,
Time taken in reaching top of the hill is : d/2 &
Time taken in coming down the hill is : d/4
Thus, 
Average speed = Total Distance / Total Time Taken i.e.
AS = (d+d) / (d/2+d/4)
AS = 4*2d / 2d+d
AS = 8d / 3d = 8/3 or 2.67 mph.

85.There are 100 cards on a table numbered 1,2,..,99,100. 
What is the maximum number of cards which can be selected such that no two cards have a product which is a perfect square ?
Example - You cannot choose the cards with number 27 and 48 as 27*48=81*16=36^2

Answer - 61
Logic - We cannot choose two numbers whose square-free part is the same but any two numbers which have a square-free part which is different won't produce a square as a product. This means we could just choose all the numbers which are completely square-free i.e have no factor which is a square. This results in the following set :-
{1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,13,14,15,17,19,21,22,23,26,29,30,31,33,34,35,37,38,39,41,42,43,46,47,51,53,55,57,58,59,61,62,65,66,67,69,70,71,73,74,77,78,79,82,83,85,86,87,89,91,93,94,95,97}

96.The numbers from 1 to 1000 are written on a board. 
You are allowed to select any two numbers, erase them and write their difference on the board. 
If this process is repeated often enough, there is only one number written on the board.
Is this number always even, always odd or can it be even or odd ?

Answer :- This number is always even.
Logic - Let L be the number of odd numbers on the board at any step, and note that initially L is even. At each step, either -
- Two odd numbers are selected, in which case two odds are deleted, and an even added;
- Two even numbers are selected, in which case no odds are deleted and one even added;
- One of each is selected, in which case one odd is deleted, and one odd is added.
In any case, the number of odd numbers is always even. 
Hence, at the last step when only one number is left, the number of odd numbers on the board must be even and less than 1. 
Hence there are no odd numbers on the board and the result is even.

105.There is a group of 300 Twitter users. 
Each user is following exactly one other user in the group. 
Prove that there exists a smaller group of 100 users where no one is following anyone else.

Logic :- 

Imagine all 300 Twitterites are standing in a room. Each person follows one other, so the average number of followers a person has is one. This means there exists a person P with at most one follower. We select person P to be in the smaller group, and we dismiss the person P follows and the one person following P (if there is such a person) from the room. Now nobody left in the room follows or is followed by P. We repeat this process. Each time, we choose a person in the room who has at most one follower still in the room, we add that person to the smaller group, and we lose at most three people from the room (the person we add to the smaller group, the person they follow, and the person following them, if there is one). The room starts with 300 people, so we can do this 100 times, resulting in a small group of 100 people in which nobody follows anybody else.

Logic - For the more visually inclined, arrange all positive integers in a 5-wide chart, as follows - 
 1   2   3   4   5
 6   7   8   9  10
11  12  13  14  15
16  17  18  19  20
21  22  23  24  25
26  27  28  29  30

56  57  58  59  60
61  62  63  64  65
66  67  68  69  70
..  ..  ..  ..  ..
To start, all the values in the right most column are divisible by 5, and thus can be made up simply of a number of 5-cent stamps. They can all be eliminated.
 1   2   3   4  --
 6   7   8   9  --
11  12  13  14  --

61  62  63  64  --
66  67  68  69  --
..  ..  ..  ..  --
Note that if you can generate a solution for any particular value on the chart, you can also generate a solution for the value directly below it by adding one 5-cent stamp. Likewise, you can find a solution for the next value down by adding another 5-cent stamp, and this cascades down into infinity.
Thus, since a solution for the value 17 is simply a single 17-cent stamp, we can eliminate that and every value below it in the second column.

61  --  63  64  --
66  --  68  69  --
..  --  ..  ..  --
Similarly, since a solution for the value 34 is two 17-cent stamps, we can eliminate that and every value below it in the fourth column.
 1   2   3   4  --
 6   7   8   9  --

51  --  53  --  --
56  --  58  --  --
61  --  63  --  --
66  --  68  --  --
..  --  ..  --  --
Since a solution for the value 51 is three 17-cent stamps, we can eliminate that and every value below it in the first column.
 1   2   3   4  --
 6   7   8   9  --
11  12  13  14  --
16  --  18  19  --

--  --  58  --  --
--  --  63  --  --
--  --  68  --  --
--  --  ..  --  --
Finally, since a solution for the value 68 is four 17-cent stamps, we can eliminate that and every value below it in the third column.
 1   2   3   4  --

120.A CEO of a multi-million dollar business has to go on a business trip to Las Vegas.
Before going to the airport in the morning with his limousine, he's going to the office first to get some files that he forgot the previous night.
When arriving at the office, the night guard opens the gate & door for him. 
The CEO gets the files and drinks a coffee while chatting a bit with the guard, and he mentions that he's flying to LV today for a deal he cannot miss, it would bring millions of dollars to the business.
The night guard looks shocked, and explains why.
Guard: I just had a dream this night. A plane that would fly to LV is going to crash in the middle of the Ocean.
The night guard begs his CEO not to go on this business trip. 
And the CEO believes him. He doesn't go to the airport and cancels his flight. 
Later that day, on the news, an air-plane crash. It was the plane that flew to LV. It crashed in the middle of the ocean.
The CEO thanks the night guard later and gives him $10.000.
The CEO also tells the night guard that he's fired.
Why did the CEO fire the night guard after he saved his life ?

Answer :- He had the dream this night which means that he was sleeping during his shift.

121.One mosquito is born at T=0 and after 2 seconds it makes a new mosquito, and another every second thereafter. 
All such mosquitoes have this same property and do not die. 
How many mosquitoes there are at T=8.5?

Answer :- 34
Logic - 
Python Script - 
def mosquitos(stopTime=8.5):
     adults = 0
     juveniles = 0
     infants = 1
     time = 0
     while time <= stopTime:
         yield time, adults + juveniles + infants
         adults += juveniles
         juveniles = infants
         infants = adults
         time += 1
At T=0 there is 1 infant, at T=1 that infant becomes a juvenile and at T=2 the same mosquito becomes an adult. 
At every time step of one second the number of new adults increases as the juveniles mature to adults, the new juveniles are simply the old infants, and the new infants are equal in number to all of the adults. Writing m for baby mosquitoes and M for adult mosquitoes - 
t=0 m
t=1 M
t=2 Mm
t=3 MMm
t=4 MMMmm
t=5 MMMMMmmm
t=6 MMMMMMMMmmmmm
t=7 MMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmm
t=8 MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Baby mosquitoes grow into adult mosquitoes. 
Each adult mosquito produces a baby mosquito for the next generation.
The recurrence relation is -
adults(t+1) = adults(t) + babies(t)  // babies grow into adults
babies(t+1) = adults(t)              // adults each produce a baby
Thus, total(8) = adults(8) + babies(8) = 21 + 13 = 34
There are 34 mosquitoes at t=8. If you play about with the recurrence relation you can deduce,
total(t+2) = adults(t+2) + babies(t+2) 
           = adults(t+1) + babies(t+1) + adults(t+1) 
           = total(t+1) + total(t)
The sequence 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34 is the famous Fibonacci Sequence.

122.There are two cars, Car A and Car B. 
Each can only carry enough fuel to travel 100 miles. 
You set out on a journey with both cars. 
In the middle of the journey one car can transfer some amount of fuel to another car but should have enough fuel left to travel back home. 
One car has to go far away and one car has to return home. 
What is the highest possible distance you can travel from your home ?

Answer :- 133 1/3 miles.

Logic - 
You drive both cars 33 1/3 miles. Then you transfer 33 1/3 miles worth of gas from one car to the other. That car now has enough gas to go another 100 miles, and the other car has exactly 33 1/3 miles worth of gas left in the tank. That's just enough to get home.

126.Bud and Terence visit a Christmas Market.
Bud checks his money and notes that he could buy 8 gingerbreads and 1 wheatbread and is left with 70 rs and cannot buy anything further.
Terence checks his money and states that he can also do it in a way that 70 rs are left but prefers to take 5 gingerbreads and 2 wheatbreads and 40 rs are left.
If Bud and Terence put their money together, they can take 9 gingerbreas and 4 wheatbreads and are left with 50 rs.
What is the price for one gingerbread and for one wheatbread ?

Answer :- 
Let A=gingerbread and B =wheatbread 
Let X=Money of Bud and Y=Money of Terence

The conditions are - 
8A+B+70=X
A,B>70
5A+2B+40=Y
9A+4B+50=X+Y
From the three identities, we get 
B=4A+60
X=12A+130
Y=13A+160
Now consider the possibilities of u,v
Case v=0 :
(u−13)A=90 , Since A>70, we must have u=14, which leads to A=90,B=420
Case v=1 :
(u−9)A=30, This has no solution with A>70
Case v=2 :
(5−u)A=30, This also has no solution with A>70
Case v=3 :
(1−u)A=90 , Since A>70, we must have u=0, which leads to A=90,B=420
