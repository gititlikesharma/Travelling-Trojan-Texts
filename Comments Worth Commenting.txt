// Dear code maintainer
//
// This source contains COM interfaces, not to be confused with interfaces 
// of any other sort, please do not just willy-nilly add additional methods 
// to these interfaces as they are truely immutable, unlike the interfaces 
// that other software vendors like Microsoft maintain.  IF you need to add 
// new functionality, then go thru the trouble of creating a NEW interface 
// and implement this functionality on only the objects you need.  
// While the money is good for fixing all of the problems caused by not 
// following the rules, I would rather work on things which actually have
// an impact on the future of the product rather than curse and yell 
// obsenities at the screen because someone didn't bother to understand the
// true meaning of IMMUTABLE.  
//**************************************

//The following 6969 lines of code in this next method 
//is a line by line port from VB.NET to C#.
//I ported this code but did not write the original code.
//It remains to me a mystery as to what
//the business logic is trying to accomplish here other than to serve as
//some sort of a compensation shell game invented by a den of thieves.
//Oh well, everyone wants this stuff to work the same as before.
//I guess the devil you know is better than the devil you don't.

//  Hey, your shoe's untied !
Followed by some dubious code, and within that code,
//  Keep looking ! I think it was the other shoe !

// For the sins I am about to commit, May [Language Creator Name] forgive me !

// I don't understand how the following bit works, but it worked in the program I stole it from.

// If I from the future read this I'll back in time and kill myself. 

// This code was written by a genius so don't try to understand it with your tiny little brain.
